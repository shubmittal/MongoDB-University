Answers:

can not nest a $facet stage as a sub-pipeline: Facets cannot be nested. This is correct explaination of the error.
facet_2 uses the output of a parallel sub-pipeline, facet_1, to compute an expression : This is correct explaination for the error. refer to statement "The output of one sub-pipeline can not be used as the input for a different sub-pipeline within the same $facet stage."  in mongodb manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/facet/index.html>


Incorrect answers:

1. a $type expression does not take a string as its value; only the BSON numeric values can be specified to identify the types. : $type can take a string as well but "integer" is not a vlaid string it can accpet. refer : https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/type/index.html. So yes, this statement results in an error but the reason specified by this point is incorrect.

2. a $multiply expression takes a document as input, not an array. : $multiply takes an array.
3. $sortByCount cannot be used within $facet stage: $sortByCount is allowed in $facet stage.
